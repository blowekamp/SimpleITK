A pass band sets to zero any value outside the defined range, and let pass without modification the input image inside the band.\n\nInstead, a stop band can be set between the threshold values. In this case, the delimited band acts as a stop band, setting values to zero in this range, and does not modify input image values outside this range. Set a stop band using SetPassBand(false), but it is clearer to use SetStopBand(bool, bool) that also control behaviour at band boundaries.\n\nThe boundaries of the bands are controlled with SetPassLow(High)FrequencyThreshold(bool). The default is to let pass low and high boundaries. Also, SetPassBand(true, false), will let pass low boundary/threshold, and stop the high value.\n\nThis filter derives from UnaryFrequencyDomainFilter and implements its own custom functor. If a different functor is set, the normal functionality of this filter will be lost.\n\n\\see UnaryFrequencyDomainFilter",
